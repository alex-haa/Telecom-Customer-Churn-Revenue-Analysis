### Data Preparation for Tableau

#### Required Data Fields
```sql
-- Customer Demographics
customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

-- Service Information
PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, 
OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies

-- Contract & Billing
Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges

-- Behavioral Data
tenure, Churn

-- Calculated Fields
customer_segment, churn_risk, clv, estimated_lifetime_value
```

#### Calculated Fields for Tableau
1. **Customer Segment**:
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN [Contract] = "Month-to-month" AND [tenure] < 12 THEN "High Risk - New Month-to-Month"
    WHEN [Contract] = "Month-to-month" AND [tenure] >= 12 THEN "Medium Risk - Established Month-to-Month"
    WHEN [Contract] = "One year" AND [tenure] < 6 THEN "Medium Risk - New Annual"
    WHEN [Contract] = "Two year" THEN "Low Risk - Long-term"
    ELSE "Stable - Established Annual"
END
```

2. **Churn Risk Score**:
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN [Contract] = "Month-to-month" AND [tenure] < 12 THEN 5
    WHEN [Contract] = "Month-to-month" AND [tenure] < 24 THEN 4
    WHEN [Contract] = "One year" AND [tenure] < 6 THEN 3
    WHEN [Contract] = "Two year" THEN 1
    ELSE 2
END
```

3. **Customer Lifetime Value**:
```sql
IF ISNULL([TotalCharges]) OR [TotalCharges] = "" THEN [MonthlyCharges] * [tenure]
ELSE [TotalCharges]
END
```

4. **Revenue Lost**:
```sql
IF [Churn] = "Yes" THEN [MonthlyCharges] * 12
ELSE 0
END
```
